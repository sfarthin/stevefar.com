					span Simple Contacts / Simple Health
					span Senior Engineer
					span May 2017 to Present
				p I made major architecture contributions on all levels of the organization:
				ul
					li Transformed Simple Contacts' eye exam from an app with a basic time-based video recorder into an intelligent cross-platform interactive eye test that responds to the patient. 
					li Built exam flow logic and custom ML models for face detection, eye occlusion, distance calculations, and speech detection from our labeled data. Put together process for training models on GPU machines and then did the integration on the web, mobile and servers.
					li Architectured a method of capturing the exam experience and playing it back in a sandbox for evaluation. This allowed us to measure the effect of code or model changes on historic exams.
					li Implemented original system to generate <a href="https://github.com/SimpleContacts/mysql-simulator">the API model layer from SQL migrations</a>. Similarly, I developed the original system to generate type-safe react code given GraphQL queries. These systems has been utilized across all out administrative, react native and the web products. 
					li Gathered a consensus on code conventions, I introduced a series of code-mods to transform the fragmented codebase and maintained these conventions accross projects with a series of custom eslint rules.
					li Transformed our client-side web app into SEO optimized web service <a href="https://github.com/SimpleContacts/react-router-async-routes">through server rendering and lazy loading of assets</a>.
