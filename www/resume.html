Put together process for training models on GPU machines and then did the integration on the web, mobile and servers.</li><li>Architectured a method of capturing the exam experience and playing it back in a sandbox for evaluation. This allowed us to measure the effect of code or model changes on historic exams.</li><li>Implemented original system to generate <a href="https://github.com/SimpleContacts/mysql-simulator">the API model layer from SQL migrations</a>. Similarly, I developed the original system to generate type-safe react code given GraphQL queries. These systems has been utilized across all out administrative, react native and the web products. </li><li>Gathered a consensus on code conventions, I introduced a series of code-mods to transform the fragmented codebase and maintained these conventions accross projects with a series of custom eslint rules.</li><li>Transformed our client-side web app into SEO optimized web service <a href="https://github.com/SimpleContacts/react-router-async-routes">through server rendering and lazy loading of assets</a>.</li></ul></article><article><h3><span>Airclass (a Lenovo Software product)</span><span>Senior Engineer</span><span>July 2016 to May 2017</span></h3><p>Airclass is a rich, immersive experience of a live training environment. I worked to make this WebRTC application scale and function in constrained cooperate environments as well as built up other collaborative features such as realtime annotations. Given the success of this feature, it has been integrated into other products.</p></article><article><h3><span>Quinncia</span><span>Cofounder and CTO</span><span>February 2015 to July 2016</span></h3><p>Quinncia was accepted in the StartupNext Boston accelerator with 8 other elite startups. All the technologies were developed by myself including "filler word" detection, generated questions based on the user's experience and reliably recording the student within the web browser plugin-free.</p></article><article><h3><span>teamDigital</span><span>Senior Engineer</span><span>December 2014 to January 2015</span></h3><p>I developed a platform that enabled the realtime moderation and judging of multiple SoundCloud.com, MLB, and NFL contests. Because of its success, the tool was repurposed as a universal moderation/judging tool for other contests.</p></article><article><h3><span>Social Psychology Network</span><span>Lead Engineer</span><span>July 2009 to December 2014</span></h3><p>As part of a small NSF-funded team, I built interactive psychological demonstrations in addition to a profile platform for thousands of social psychologists to show their research. I also helped put together the largest course on Coursera, "Social Psychology" for hundred of thousands of students and worked with Coursera staff to include a new unique feature for the course.</p></article></div><div class="education"><h2>Education</h2><div><article><h3>B.S. in Computer Science, Indiana University</h3><p>2005 - 2009</p></article><article><h3>M.A. in Liberal Arts, Wesleyan University</h3><p>2009 - 2014</p></article></div></div></body></html>
