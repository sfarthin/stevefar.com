I pitched to potential customers and coordinated the business goals with the cofounder, contracted designer and occasional part-time developer to complete the milestones. Quinncia was accepted in the StartupNext Boston accelerator with 8 other elite startups. Within this program, we worked with UX experts and focus groups to refine the product. We partnered with career centers and incorporated our platform into career courses. Our mock interviews generate questions for students based on their resume, major and experience and speak the question to them. The student responds to the questions and are recorded. The recording is analyzed for facial expressions and filler words and given to the career advisor to provide feedback to the student. All the technologies were developed by myself including the application of research in deep learning of facial expressions, reliably recording the student within the web browser plugin-free, and universal javascript with React.</p></article><article><h3>teamDigital, December 2014 to January 2015</h3><p>I developed a platform that enabled the realtime moderation and judging of multiple SoundCloud.com contests.
