	//- 	p(style="line-height: 28px") Quinncia, an automated interview platform and marketplace for students and employers, was cofounded by a business lead and myself as the tech lead. I pitched to potential customers and coordinated the business goals with the cofounder, contracted designer and occasional part-time developer to complete the milestones. Quinncia was accepted in the StartupNext Boston accelerator with 8 other elite startups. Within this program, we worked with UX experts and focus groups to refine the product. 
	//- 	p(style="line-height: 28px") We partnered with career centers and incorporated our platform into career courses. Our mock interviews generate questions for students based on their resume, major and experience and speak the question to them. The student responds to the questions and are recorded. The recording is analyzed for facial expressions and filler words and given to the career advisor to provide feedback to the student. All the technologies were developed by myself including the application of research in deep learning of facial expressions, reliably recording the student within the web browser plugin-free, and universal javascript with React.
	//- 	//- p(style="line-height: 36px;color: #ddd;margin-top: 30px;") Quinncia is a job marketplace for students and employers. Our automated interviews, similar to a Skype interview with Siri, help student's highlight their personality and abilities. Hiring managers are interviewed to give insights to job expectations and company culture.
	//- 	//- p(style="line-height: 36px;") In addition, we partner with university career centers to provide video analysis and feedback tools so advisors can send quality feedback directly to their students.

	//- 	//- 	Social Psychology Network offers an interactive directory who specialize in social or personality psychology. The Files Uploading System allows Psychology professionals to upload and manage: high-resolution images, slides or lecture notes from a presentation, data files and codebooks from research, supplemental material related to a publication, unpublished manuscripts and preprints, or brochures describing books and other projects. Utilizing XHR uploads for capable browsers and workarounds for older browsers, this feature allows the user to continue managing their profile while uploads finish in the background. In addition, this feature takes advantage of the HTML5 file upload API for previewing and rotating images before the uploads are finished uploading. Using this HTML5 fatures, the system is optimized so a user is not required to wait for file uploads while editing their profile. I developed this application and contributed to its design.

	//- 				p Having been awarded a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0843855" target="_blank">grant</a> from the National Science Foundation, the Network hired myself to build a web community and continue their mission. As part of their small team, I built interactive psychological demonstrations in addition to a profile platform for thousands of social psychologists to show their research. I trained and managed student interns to help with testing and support requests. I also helped put together the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/socialpsychology" target="_blank">largest course on Coursera</a>, "Social Psychology" for hundred of thousands of students and worked with Coursera staff to include a new unique feature for the course.
	//- 				//- p I incorporated software development practices such as Git, Codeigniter (a PHP framework) and semantic markup and CSS instead of table design into the exisiting LAMP systems. Over time, uptime and server load became a problem at the university so I lead the process of setting up new virtual servers while proxing exisiting content. I took this opportunity to develop a modern MEAN stack which included push to deploy, Grunt/Gulp task managing, modern javascript libraries such as <strong>Angular.js</strong> (see my <a href="http://gist.io/8871692" target="_blank">blog post</a>) and <strong>Backbone.js</strong>, Nginx webserver and proxy server, <strong>Node.js</strong> services such as socket.io, unit/e2e test, <strong>Docker</strong> for deployments, optimized Require.js, and compiled LESS.

Experts in social psychology are given special profiles within the network. Users, for example, can pinpoint their geographic location, upload and manipulate images, display their <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/upload/view/85057/statement.pdf" target="_blank">Coursera statements of accomplishments</a>, list publications, and upload datafile uploads. This information can be displayed on their <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/member/farthing" target="_blank">public profile</a>. Over 5,000 users have cropped a photo and pinpointed a geographic location and are placed in the <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/membership-directory" target="_blank">Membership Directory</a>.
