		p.intro I am a <a href="/#web-developer">web developer</a>, <a href="/#artist">artist and musician</a> living in central Connecticut. I have developed each level involved in building a web application, from cutting edge CSS and javascript on the frontend to deploying and scaling backend servers. As a visual artist I have experience with traditional art such as printmaking, sumi-e painting and portraiture. I am a folk singer, songwriter and have played a number of different instruments live and in the studio.

I have applied this understanding of composition and tools such as masking or overlayering elements to both my physical and digital work. I also have experience drawing and have focused on the portrait as well as the figure. I am comfortable manipulating photos with Adobe Photoshop as well as creating vector art with Adobe Illustrator.

			Social Psychology Network offers an interactive directory who specialize in social or personality psychology. The Files Uploading System allows Psychology professionals to upload and manage: high-resolution images, slides or lecture notes from a presentation, data files and codebooks from research, supplemental material related to a publication, unpublished manuscripts and preprints, or brochures describing books and other projects. Utilizing XHR uploads for capable browsers and workarounds for older browsers, this feature allows the user to continue managing their profile while uploads finish in the background. In addition, this feature takes advantage of the HTML5 file upload API for previewing and rotating images before the uploads are finished uploading. Using this HTML5 fatures, the system is optimized so a user is not required to wait for file uploads while editing their profile. I developed this application and contributed to its design.

						h6 July 2009 to Present
						p Social Psychology Network's mission is to promote peace, social justice, and sustainable living. The Network was awarded a <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0843855" target="_blank">grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> and hired myself to join the one other full-time technical lead. I created interactive maps and directories, interative Social Psychology demonstrations and helped put together <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/socialpsychology" target="_blank">the largest online class on Coursera</a>.
						p I incorporated software development practices such as Git, Codeigniter (a PHP framework) and semantic markup and CSS instead of table design into the exisiting LAMP systems. Over time, uptime and server load became a problem at the university so I lead the process of setting up new virtual servers while proxing exisiting content. I took this opportunity to develop a modern MEAN stack which included push to deploy, Grunt/Gulp task managing, modern javascript libraries such as <strong>Angular.js</strong> (see my <a href="http://gist.io/8871692" target="_blank">blog post</a>) and <strong>Backbone.js</strong>, Nginx webserver and proxy server, <strong>Node.js</strong> services such as socket.io, unit/e2e test, <strong>Docker</strong> for deployments, optimized Require.js, and compiled LESS.

The CultureU project grew to include 30 students and faculty who actively contributed.

						p <img src="/img/spn-logo.png" style="float:left;width: 100px;margin: 0px 10px;">Social Psychology Network allows its member's to make their own page on the network. Experts in social psychology are given special profiles within the network. Users, for example, can pinpoint their geographic location, upload and manipulate images, display their <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/upload/view/85057/statement.pdf" target="_blank">Coursera statements of accomplishments</a>, list publications, and upload datafile uploads. This information can be displayed on their <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/member/farthing" target="_blank">public profile</a>. Over 5,000 users have cropped a photo and pinpointed a geographic location and are placed in the <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/membership-directory" target="_blank">Membership Directory</a>. I developed all parts of this application and contributed to a large part of its design. Some pieces of this system have been open sourced and are referenced in the code examples below.

						p <img src="/img/marker-group.png" style="float:left;width: 100px;margin: 10px 10px;">This interactive map allows the user to search thousands of profiled social psychology experts. Experts can be found geographically by zooming and panning the map or limiting by research topics. The user can also limit the map to media contacts, expert witnesses, public speakers, and other types of experts. I developed this application and contributed to its design. I created a <a href="https://stevefar.com/marker-flock/" target="_blank">plugin that would cluster markers into groups</a> for use on the maps. I also developed the <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/maps/gradprograms" target="_blank">Graduate Program Map</a> and the <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/maps/researchgroups" target="_blank">Research Group Map</a>.

						p <img src="/img/segregation.png" style="float:left;width: 100px;margin: 10px 10px;">Building on the work of Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling, this interactive learning resource shows that small social preferences at the individual level can generate surprising patterns of segregation at the group level, and it shows how the same dynamic can be used to reverse segregation. A teacher who uses this app in his classroom wrote:

				p This repository holds all the code used to produce this website (<a href="//stevefar.com">SteveFar.com</a>). It is optimized with minified assests, vector images (SVG), and accomplishes all its interactivity without any client side javascript. It demonstrates an understanding of responsive design and use of visual frameworks (this page uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>). I use advanced CSS (such as animation and flexbox) and use LESS mixins to accommodate browser prefixes and quirks. I am able to develop rapidly with tools such as Jade and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> (A less verbose task manager than Grunt). I also developed my resume in HTML/CSS and made it printable from the browser.

				p This library revels methods that allow image cropping, rotating, resizing, and xhr uploads. The <a href="http://floating-spire-3371.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">demo</a> uses Requirejs, Angularjs, JCrop and uploads these images directly to Google Cloud Storage (using library in next code example). Over <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/membership-directory" target="_blank">6,000 Social Psychology Network members</a> have selected their portrait photo using these methods.

				h3 <a href="https://github.com/sfarthin/nodejs-google-cloud-storage" target="_blank">Google Cloud Storage Signed URLs for Node.js</a>
				h6 $ npm install <strong>gcs-signed-urls</strong>
				p I created this NPM module so that I can create web apps that allow users to upload directly to Google Cloud Storage. Using <a href="https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/accesscontrol#Signed-URLs" target="_blank">Signed URLs</a> I am able to control access with Node.js and a private key. Due to the fact that there is no Node.js SDK for Google Cloud Storage, the cryptographic signatures were coded using Node.js's crypto module to Google's specification. This integration alleviates much of the maintenance required in storing and handing file uploads in web apps while at the same time not complicating the uploading process by acting as a middleman between the user and Google Cloud Storage.
			div
				h3 <a href="https://github.com/sfarthin/node-process-manager" target="_blank">Node.js Process Manager</a>
				h6 $ npm install <strong>node-process-manager</strong>
				p I created this NPM module to manage node processes. It respawns node processes if the process quits unexpectedly, it shuts processes down gracefully to prevent any dropped connections (such as file uploads), and monitors stdout on a set of node processes.
