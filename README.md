============
This repository holds all the code used to produce this website (SteveFar.com). It is optimized with minified assests, vector images (SVG), and accomplishes all its interactivity without any client side javascript. It demonstrates an understanding of responsive design and use of visual frameworks (bootstrap). I use advanced CSS (such as animation and flexbox) and use LESS mixins to accommodate browser prefixes and quirks. I am able to develop rapidly with tools such as Jade and Gulp. This repo also holds my resume which is built in HTML/CSS and printable from the browser.

### File/Directory Explanations

**style**: All the LESS files. Gulp compiles these LESS files and places them in the www directory

**www**: Holds all the static assests as well as built assests such as LESS and jade

**index.jade**: This jade file is compiled into html and placed into the www directory.
